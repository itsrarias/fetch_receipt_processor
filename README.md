# Receipt Processor

A simple web service that awards points based on receipt data.

## üßÆ Point Calculation Rules

Points are calculated using the following rules:

- **Retailer name characters:**  
  One point for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.

- **Round dollar total:**  
  50 points if the total is a round dollar amount with no cents.

- **Multiple of 0.25:**  
  25 points if the total is a multiple of 0.25.

- **Items:**  
  5 points for every two items.

- **Item description length multiple of 3:**  
  For each item whose (trimmed) description length is a multiple of 3, multiply the item's price by 0.2 and round up to the nearest integer. Add that to the total points.

- **Odd day:**  
  6 points if the day in the purchase date is odd.

- **Afternoon purchase (2pm - 4pm):**  
  10 points if the time is strictly after 2:00pm and strictly before 4:00pm.

## üîå Endpoints

The service provides two endpoints:

### `POST /receipts/process`

- Accepts JSON for a receipt.
- Returns a JSON object containing a unique id.

### `GET /receipts/{id}/points`

- Returns the points awarded to the receipt specified by the provided id.

‚ö†Ô∏è All data is stored **in memory** and will be lost on application restart.

‚ùì FAQ

Q1: My PowerShell terminal doesn‚Äôt accept -X in curl?
A1: PowerShell aliases curl to Invoke-WebRequest. Use:

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/receipts/<id>/points" -Method GET

Or use curl.exe directly.

Q2: Will the data persist after I stop the app?
A2: No. The app uses in-memory storage. Restarting the app or container will clear the data.

Q3: How do I confirm my scoring logic is correct?

Use the sample receipts:

    The Target receipt should return 28 points

    The M&M Corner Market example should return 109 points

If they match, your logic is solid.
