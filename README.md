# Receipt Processor

A simple web service that awards points based on receipt data.

---

## 🔌 Endpoints

The service provides two endpoints:

### `POST /receipts/process`

- Accepts JSON for a receipt.
- Returns a JSON object containing a unique id.

### `GET /receipts/{id}/points`

- Returns the points awarded to the receipt specified by the provided id.

⚠️ All data is stored **in memory** and will be lost on application restart.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q1: My PowerShell terminal doesn’t accept `-X` in curl?**  
A1: PowerShell aliases `curl` to `Invoke-WebRequest`. Use:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8080/receipts/<id>/points" -Method GET
```

Or use `curl.exe` directly.

---

**Q2: Will the data persist after I stop the app?**  
A2: No. The app uses in-memory storage. Restarting the app or container will clear the data.

---

**Q3: How do I confirm my scoring logic is correct?**  
Use the sample receipts:

- The **Target** receipt should return **28 points**
- The **M&M Corner Market** example should return **109 points**

If they match, your logic is solid.
